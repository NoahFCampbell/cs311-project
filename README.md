# CourseFinder

Group project for the 60-311 Intro to Software Engineering class.

It's a course finder website for a selection of University of Windsor courses,
allowing you to more easily plan your courses in the long-term. It also
provides students more information about the courses themselves, such as
reviews, past professors who have taught the course, when the course is
typically offered, etc.
